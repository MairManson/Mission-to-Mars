# Mission-to-Mars
Build an app to scrape different websites using Splinter and BeautifulSoup to extract data about the Mission to Mars; store the data in MongoDB; render the data to a webpage built with Flask; and design a webpage with Bootstrap to link to the project. 

-- Built out the Flask routes 

-- Each scraping section is separated into its own function, which will make reusing the code much simpler.

-- Set up a Mongo database to hold the scraped data 

 -- Integrate Mongo into the web app that tells the script to update the data stored in Mongo each time it's run
